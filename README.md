# Eureka Chandrasekhar prize 2025-12-19/2026-02-14 (probably)
This is a repository to store the information, documentation, and code for the Chandrasekhar Eureka prize.

# The idea
A telescope, fully functioning telescope that can operate in broad daylight, and here's the best part: it eliminates cosmological redshift using Hubble’s law. Cosmological redshift is a real problem among astronomers, it can distort images of space, and hinder our observations as well as limiting our understanding. We can have like a live demonstration of this telescope, and we can compare the results with what redshift would do to these images.

# Organization
Use folders; there shall be a specific folder for each category. You may create your own subfolders underneath.

## Simulations
You may upload any sort of code files in any language, such as Java, C++, etc.

## 3D prototypes
STL or OBJ only

## Notes and information
Use .txt files for quick note-taking.

## Proper and formal presentations source code
Use .tex files (LaTeX, it is the best typesetting interface.)

## Proper and formal presentations themselves
Use .pdf files.

# Guidelines
For code, use that language's guidelines. For folders and filenames, use `kebab-case`.
